# Matrix Class Project

## Project Overview
**Feb 2024 - Mar 2024**

Developed a robust **Matrix Class** in Java, enabling efficient manipulation of matrices. The class facilitates essential matrix operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and transposition. Implemented using Java fundamentals, the Matrix Class leverages primitive data types, control structures, methods, arrays, exceptions, and classes.

## Key Features
- **Matrix Operations:** Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication (element-wise and matrix product), and transposition.
- **Error Handling:** Includes exception handling for invalid operations like dimension mismatches or non-invertible matrices.
- **Efficiency:** Uses Javaâ€™s primitive data types and arrays for optimal performance in handling matrix calculations.
- **Test-Driven Development:** Thoroughly tested with unit tests to ensure correctness and reliability.

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Java
- **Testing:** JUnit (Test-Driven Development)
- **Concepts Applied:** Linear Algebra, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Error Handling

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile using a Java IDE or command line with `javac Matrix.java`.
3. Run unit tests using JUnit to verify functionality.
